I am a Associate Scientist at [Institute of Applied Cancer Science](http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/departments-programs-and-labs/programs-centers-institutes/institute-for-applied-cancer-science/index.html)/[Genomic Medine](http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/departments-programs-and-labs/departments-and-divisions/genomic-medicine/index.html), [MD Anderson Cancer Center](http://www.cancermoonshots.org/research/).

During the last few years I have collaborated on several different problems in cancer genomics; you may find list of my [publications on scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aXwxLwEAAAAJ). I have also created several software packages, which are available on [github](http://github.com/sahilseth).
