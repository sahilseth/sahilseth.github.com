I am an Associate Scientist at [Institute of Applied Cancer Science][iacs]/[Genomic Medine][gm], [MD Anderson Cancer Center](http://www.cancermoonshots.org/research/).

During the last few years I have collaborated on several different problems in
cancer genomics; leading to a few publications (summarized on [google scholar][scholar]).
I have also created several software packages, which are available on
[github](http://github.com/sahilseth) and summarized in the [software page][soft].
