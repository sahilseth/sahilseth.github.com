An updated set of links and packages for machine learning in R

For R, CRAN task views are a major source of package listings on a topic. 
Specifically [Machine Learning](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html) view has links to 87 (as of Feb 05, 2017) such packages.

Although, each package serves a purpose and complements others in certain ways. It may be daunting to work with multiple packages
each with their peculiar interfaces.
Interestingly some of the packages have picked up on the tidy-data principles.

A few recent interesting packages are `mlr`, `pipelearner`, `modelr` and `broom`. Each of these are trying to attack the same problem 
of arriving at a coherent approach to machine learing in R.
